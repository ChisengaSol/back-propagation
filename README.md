# Back-Propagation Implementation

This repository contains an implementation of back-propagation from scratch. The implementation consists of three files:

1. **back_propagation.py**: Defines the BackPropagation class, which implements the back-propagation algorithm for training a neural network.
   
2. **generate_data.py**: Defines a function `generate_data()` that generates data to be used for training and testing of the neural network.

3. **main.py**: Runs the back-propagation process using the defined classes and functions.

## Dependencies

- numpy
- matplotlib

Ensure you have numpy and matplotlib installed. You can install them via pip:

```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the files directly.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the files.

3. Run the following command to execute the main script:

```
python main.py
```

This will run the back-propagation process and display the results using matplotlib. The accuracy of the model is displayed in the terminal.

## File Descriptions

### back_propagation.py

Contains the implementation of the BackPropagation class, which is responsible for training the neural network using the back-propagation algorithm.

### generate_data.py

Defines the `generate_data()` function, which generates data required for training and testing of the neural network.

### main.py

Executes the back-propagation process using the defined class and functions. This is the main script to be run.
